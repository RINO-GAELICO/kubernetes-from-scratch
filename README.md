# Kubernetes from scratch

The purpose of this repository is to boostrap a very basic Kubernetes environment for experimenting with custom implementations of Kubernetes components. Pre-built container images are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/chazapis/kubernetes-from-scratch) (note the architecture).

Based on the excellent [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and [Kubernetes Deployment From Scratch - The Ultimate Guide](https://www.ulam.io/blog/kubernetes-scratch).
